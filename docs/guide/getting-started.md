# Getting started

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher.
- Terminal for accessing VitePress via its command line interface (CLI).
- Text Editor with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax support.
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended.

VitePress can be used on its own, or be installed into an existing project. In both cases, you can install it with:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npm create @taoro/game <project name>
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm create @taoro/game <project name>
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn create @taoro/game <project name>
```

```sh [bun]
$ bun create @taoro/game <project name>
```
